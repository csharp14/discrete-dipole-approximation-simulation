# discrete-dipole-approximation-simulation
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

(WIP - Project incomplete) This project simulates the propagation of light through complex media by emulating scattering as that from individual dipoles. Using the discrete dipole approximation, the intensity of a given incident wavefront is calculated across a 2D grid of interest.
